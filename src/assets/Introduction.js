        Hi there! I'm Ayushman Manishankar, a passionate Computer Science
        Engineer, and Fullstack Developer. My journey is fueled by a genuine
        curiosity for technology, and I'm always eager to learn and adapt to the
        latest advancements. When I'm not immersed in crafting seamless web
        experiences, you'll find me in two very different arenas: the strategic
        world of chess and the energetic realm of cricket. Chess is my mental
        workout, where I hone my problem-solving skills, while cricket unleashes
        my competitive spirit and teaches me the power of teamwork. But that's
        not all â€“ I'm also an enthusiastic music creator. Strumming my guitar
        and producing melodies is my creative escape, adding an extra rhythm to
        my life. I'm a firm believer in the value of connections, so let's
        connect! Whether it's discussing the latest tech trends, exploring
        exciting opportunities, or sharing experiences in any of my passions,
        I'm here to engage and make an impact together in this vibrant tech
        world.
